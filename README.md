# metadatacrowdsourcing v1
documentation and code for metadata crowdsourcing projects

This repository contains information and code for metadata crowdsourcing tools that were created in collaboration with Stanford University during 2012-2014, with funding from the Mellon Foundation to explore and advance crowdsourcing methods for humanities research.

The Historypin Metadata Crowdsourcing tools were designed to allow the public to contribute suggestions about specific elements of metadata, including date, location, camera angle & direction, title, and tags. Content owners would be notified of the suggestion, and it would also be shown publicly to allow further discourse, and then approval by the content owner or sent back to the queue.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/Historypin/metadatacrowdsourcing/wiki) for more information about the many elements of the community engagement built around these tools, as well as the Stanford resource pages for information about other tools: http://humanitiescrowdsourcing.stanford.edu
